The purpose of the program is to count the key presses from the keyboard. So the input hardware device is the keyboard, which sends the input to 8086 microcontroller. The keypresses are stored in the BX register of 8086, which is incremented every time input from keyboard is received (apart from esc key), while the input from keyboard is stored in the AH register, and is printed in the emulator screen when input is received.
